## Flashing instructions

See the `cyoa_ortho` folder for the QMK source.

There are example qmk files for 5x12 and 4x12 layouts for both QMK and Vial setups. These will need to be compiled using QMK or the Vial fork of Vial respectively. The `info.json` file contains all possible layouts so it should be possible to easily craft your layout using that as a starting point. 

## Precompiled firmware

There are a couple precompiled firmware examples here that you are welcome to use: 

* QMK 5x12 layout (for Pro Micro)
* QMK 4x12 layout (for Pro Micro)
* Vial 5x12 layout (for Pro Micro)
* Vial 4x12 layout (for Pro Micro)
* Vial 4x12 layout (for RP2040 Helios board)
